abstract="Can we enable anyone to create anything? The prototyping tools of a rising Maker Movement are enabling the next generation of artists, designers, educators, and engineers to bootstrap from napkin sketch to functional prototype. However for technical novices, the process of including electronic components in prototypes can hamper the creative process with technical details. Software and electronic modules can reduce the amount of work a designer must perform in order to express an idea, by condensing the number of choices into a physical and cognitive ``chunk.'' What are the core building blocks that might make up electronics toolkits of the future, and what are the key affordances? We present the idea that modularity, the ability to freely recombine elements, is a key affordance for novice prototyping with electronics. We present the results of a creative prototyping experiment (N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}86) that explores how tool modularity influences the creative design process. Using a browser-based crowd platform (Amazon's Mechanical Turk), participants created electric ``creature circuits'' with LEDs in a virtual prototyping environment. We found that increasing the modularity of LED components (i) increased the quantity of prototypes created by study participants; and (ii) increased participants' degree of perceived self-efficacy, self-reported creative feeling, and cognitive flow. The results highlight the importance of tool modularity in creative prototyping.",

abstract = {Abstract Programmable logic arrays (PLAs) are traditional digital electronic devices. A PLA is a simple programmable logic device (SPLD) used to implement combinational logic circuits. A PLA has a set of programmable AND gates, which link to a set of programmable OR gates to produce an output. The AND–OR layout of a PLA allows for implementing logic functions that are in a sum-of-products form. PLAs are available in the market in different types. PLAs could be stand alone chips, or parts of bigger processing systems. Stand alone PLAs are available as mask programmable (MPLAs) and field programmable (FPLAs) devices. The attractions of PLAs that brought them to mainstream engineers include their simplicity, relatively small circuit area, predictable propagation delay, and ease of development. The powerful-but-simple property brought PLAs to rapid prototyping, synthesis, design optimization techniques, embedded systems, traditional computer systems, hybrid high-performance computing systems, etc. Indeed, there has been renewable interests in working with the simple AND-to-OR PLAs.}

abstract="Since their inception more than thirty years ago, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have grown more complex, more capable, and more diverse in their applications. FPGAs can be reprogrammed at a fundamental level, changing the function and interconnection of millions of elements. By reconfiguring their hardware to match the application, FPGAs often achieve higher energy efficiency, lower latency or faster time-to-market across a very wide range of application domains. A modern FPGA combines many components, from logic blocks, programmable routing and memory blocks to networks-on-chip and processor subsystems. For best efficiency, each component must be carefully architected to match the needs of a wide range of applications, and to mesh well with the other components. Their design involves many different choices starting from the high-level architectural parameters down to the transistor-level implementation details. This chapter describes the evolution of these FPGA components, their design principles and implementation challenges.",

ABSTRACT = {Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), as specialized task-oriented embedded field devices, play a vital role in current industrial control systems (ICSs), which are composed of critical infrastructure. In order to meet increasing demands on cost-effectiveness while improving production efficiency, commercial-off-the-shelf software and hardware, and external networks such as the Internet, are integrated into the PLC-based control systems. However, it also provides opportunities for adversaries to launch malicious, targeted, and sophisticated cyberattacks. To that end, there is an urgent need to summarize ongoing work in PLC-based control systems on vulnerabilities, attacks, and security detection schemes for researchers and practitioners. Although surveys on similar topics exist, they are less involved in three key aspects, as follows: First and foremost, previous work focused more on system-level vulnerability analysis than PLC itself. Subsequently, it was not clear whether their work applied to the current systems or future ones, especially for security detection schemes. Finally, the prior surveys lacked a digital forensic research review of PLC-based control systems, which was significant for security analysis at different stages. As a result, we highlight vulnerability analysis at both a core component level and a system level, as well as attack models against availability, integrity, and confidentiality. Meanwhile, reviews of security detection schemes and digital forensic research for the current PLC-based systems are provided. Finally, we discuss future work for the next-generation systems.},

Currently, these systems include in their network designs different types of Information and Communication Technology systems (such as the Internet and wireless technologies), not only to modernize operational processes but also to ensure automation and real-time control. Nonetheless, the use of these new technologies will bring new security challenges, which will have a significant impact on both the business process and home users.
